## Recursion

### What is Recursion?

Recursion can be considered as a repetition proccess of a routine,
in therms of programming, recursion is when a function keeps calling itself until it get to the result, that
is a condition to finish the recursion. It is similar to a for or a while loop, even it's not a for or a while loop.
But we kind of have the same idea here.

### When to use?

Being similar to some loop methods, we can to use recursion when loop methods aren't enough for us, or we
can use recursion when the loop methods will cost more proccess and memory, so, in every case you need to make
a complexity analysis to understand what will cost more for you.
