## Recursion

### What is Recursion?

Recursion can be considered as a repetition proccess of a routine,
in therms of programming, recursion is when a function keeps calling itself until it get to the result, that
is an ending condition. It is similar to a for or a while loop, but it's not a for or a while loop, we get the same
idea tho.

### When to use?

Being similar to some loop methods, we can to use recursion when loop methods aren't enough for us, or we
can use recursion when the loop methods will cost more proccess and memory, so, in every case you need to make
a complexity analysis to understand what will cost more for you.
