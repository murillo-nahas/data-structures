## Trees

### What is Trees?

Trees are a non-linear and hierarchical data structure that consists in a collection of nodes
that each node stores a value and references to the next node. Each node in the tree can be connected
to many children (it depends on the type of the tree), but must to be connected to one parent (except the root).
The JavaScript DOM is an example of a Tree.
