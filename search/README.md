## Linear Search

### What is Linear Search?

Linear Search || Sequential Search is a method that we create to find an element within a list.
Basically, we iterate over each element of a list until we match the target element. 
In case our algorithm don't reach any target value, we have a unsuccesfull case.

### Built-in Methods

In Javascript, we can use some built-in array methods to perform the Linear Search, these are:

- indexOf();
- includes();
- find();
- findIndex();

### Time Complexity

If the target value is in the beginning of the array, we have the constant time O(1), the algorithm will perform only over one comparison.
In case the target is in the final, we have the O(n) complexity.

### When to use?

We can use the Linear Search when we have an unsorted array, such as [2, 4, 5, 3, 1], probably is the best case.
