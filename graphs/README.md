## Graphs

### What is Graphs?

Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists in vertices and edges. Vertices are referred to as the nodes
and the edges are the lines/archs that connects the nodes in the graph. You can think that graphs are similar to trees, but
trees have some more rules.

There are two ways to represent a graph:

- Adjacency Matrix: The graph is stored in the form of the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices.
- Adjacency List: The graph is represented as a collection of linked lists.

### When to use?

We can use Graphs when we need to solve complex problems with data relationships, or when we need to
represent real life problems, like chess movements, computer network, etc.
