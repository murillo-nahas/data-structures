## Linked List

### What is Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure, where the elements aren't stored
in contiguous memory. A linked list consist in nodes where each node has data and points
to the next node in the list. The first node is called head and the last node is called tail, it's a
dynamic data structure.

You can use a Linked List when you need constant time insertions from the list, when you don't need
random access to any element, when you don't know how many items will be in the list, etc.
